// Required for the nonce-based CSP in middleware.ts to actually work: Next.js only applies a
// per-request nonce to a page's script tags when that page is dynamically rendered — a
// statically-optimized page's HTML (including script tags) is baked at build time, before any
// request-scoped nonce exists, so the two can never match. Most pages here already read
// cookies()/Supabase server sessions and were already dynamic; this closes the gap for the
// handful that weren't (login, register, join, privacy) — and is a deliberately low-cost trade
// for this app, since it's a per-user dashboard SaaS with no meaningful static-caching workload
// to lose (nothing here is public marketing content that benefits from ISR/CDN caching).
