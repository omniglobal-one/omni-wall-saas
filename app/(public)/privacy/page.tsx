            <h3 className="font-semibold text-omni-ink">Introduction</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-omni-ink-soft leading-relaxed">
              OMNI Share is a photo room platform that enables room managers to create moderated photo spaces, and members to join and submit photos for display on shared walls and slideshows. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and disclose your personal information when you access and interact with our platform, whether as a room manager, a moderator, a member, or a visitor.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="space-y-2">
            <h3 className="font-semibold text-omni-ink">Information We Collect</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-omni-ink-soft leading-relaxed">
              We collect personal information you voluntarily provide when creating an account, including your name, email address, and username. When you join a room, we record your membership and the join code used. When you upload a photo, we store the image file and associated metadata such as upload timestamp, moderation status, and any rejection reason applied by a moderator.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="space-y-2">
            <h3 className="font-semibold text-omni-ink">How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-omni-ink-soft leading-relaxed">
              We use your information to operate and improve the OMNI Share platform, manage room memberships, process photo submissions and moderation decisions, display approved photos on room walls and slideshows, and communicate with you about your account. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
            </p>

          <div className="space-y-2">
            <h3 className="font-semibold text-omni-ink">Photo Uploads and Storage</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-omni-ink-soft leading-relaxed">
              Photos you upload are stored securely and associated with your account. Uploaded photos are subject to moderation by room managers or designated moderators before being displayed publicly. Approved photos may be visible to all members of a room and to anyone viewing the room&apos;s public wall display. You should not upload photos containing sensitive personal information, private images, or content you do not have the right to share.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-omni-ink">Photo Moderation</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-omni-ink-soft leading-relaxed">
              Room managers and moderators review submitted photos and may approve, reject, or delete them. When a photo is rejected, a reason may be recorded and stored alongside the photo record. Moderation actions are logged in an audit trail visible to room managers for accountability purposes. Moderators are bound by the same terms as other users and may not misuse their access.

            <h3 className="font-semibold text-omni-ink">Public Wall Display</h3>
            <p className="text-sm text-omni-ink-soft leading-relaxed">
              Rooms may have a public wall display accessible via a shareable link or QR code. Approved photos in such rooms may be viewable by anyone who accesses the wall URL, including individuals who are not registered members of the platform. The wall display uses a real-time connection to our infrastructure to show newly approved photos without requiring a page refresh. Room managers are responsible for determining whether their room&apos;s wall is shared publicly and for ensuring that displayed content is appropriate for their intended audience.

              Some rooms on OMNI Share may be created by platform administrators on behalf of an event or organisation before the room manager has registered on the platform. These unclaimed rooms are not actively managed by the event or organisation they represent. OMNI Global does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of information on unclaimed rooms and accepts no liability for any inaccuracies contained within them.
